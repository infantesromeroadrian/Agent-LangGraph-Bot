ITIL Incident Management Process Overview:

Definition: An Incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. Incident Management is the process for dealing with all incidents, including failures, questions or queries reported by users, technical staff, or automatically detected by monitoring tools.

Objective: The primary objective of Incident Management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible and minimize the adverse impact on business operations, thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained.

Key Concepts:
- Incident: Any event that disrupts or could disrupt a service
- Service Restoration: Focus on restoring service rather than finding the underlying cause
- Timescales: Handling incidents based on agreed service level agreements (SLAs)
- Prioritization: Based on impact and urgency

Incident Management Process Steps:
1. Incident Identification: Recognizing that a service disruption has occurred
2. Incident Logging: Creating a formal record of the incident
3. Incident Categorization: Assigning appropriate categories for proper tracking
4. Incident Prioritization: Determining impact and urgency to set priority
5. Initial Diagnosis: First-level investigation by service desk
6. Escalation: Functional or hierarchical if necessary
7. Investigation and Diagnosis: More detailed analysis to determine resolution
8. Resolution and Recovery: Implementing the solution
9. Incident Closure: Confirming resolution and completing documentation

Roles in Incident Management:
- Service Desk: First point of contact for users, logging and initial support
- First-level Support: Basic troubleshooting and resolution
- Second-level Support: More specialized support for complex incidents
- Third-level Support: Expert support often from vendors or specialized teams
- Incident Manager: Oversees the effectiveness of the incident management process

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Total number of incidents
- Average time to resolve incidents
- Percentage of incidents resolved within SLA
- First-call resolution rate
- Number of major incidents

Major Incident Procedure:
A separate procedure for handling high-impact incidents, typically involving:
- Dedicated resources
- Higher urgency
- Management notification
- Separate reporting
- Post-incident review

Best Practices:
- Self-service options for common incidents
- Knowledge base for quick resolutions
- Clear escalation paths
- Automated incident logging
- Regular review of recurring incidents
- Linking related incidents to problem records
